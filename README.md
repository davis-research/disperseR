# disperseR
An R package for calculating spatial seed dispersal in permanent forest plots.

This package calculates seed dispersal as a function of the distance of seedlings from adult trees in the plot. To use this package successfully, you will need, at minimum, a permanent plot data.frame with x and y coordinates as well as dbh values for each adult and locations for each seedling (just set DBH to NA). You can play around with the package using its generatePlotMap() function which will generate a random plot map for you to play with.
